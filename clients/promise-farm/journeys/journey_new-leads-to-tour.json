Bring your favorite caterer, food truck, or handle it yourself. We're here to accommodate YOUR vision.\n\n❓ WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE PACKAGE?\nDay-of coordination, tables and chairs, bridal suite access, parking attendants, and use of our getting-ready spaces. Plus, you get our expertise and support throughout planning!\n\n❓ IS THERE A GUEST MINIMUM OR MAXIMUM?\nOur space comfortably accommodates weddings from 50 to 200 guests. Whether intimate or grand, we make it work beautifully.\n\n❓ WHAT ABOUT WEATHER FOR OUTDOOR CEREMONIES?\nWe always have a backup plan! Our indoor ceremony space is equally beautiful, and we make the call together based on the forecast.\n\n❓ HOW FAR IN ADVANCE SHOULD WE BOOK?\nPrime dates (Saturdays in spring and fall) book 12-18 months ahead. But don't worry - we often have Friday and Sunday availability with shorter notice.\n\nHave other questions? We're just an email away!",
