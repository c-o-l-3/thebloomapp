Hi Cole! I actually really like these! Thank you for these thoughtful responses. I made a few notes below. 

Day 1 in the initial email we do want all the pictures we send in our usual inquiry response email. I am going to email that to you again so you can see them easily. I’ll send from our CEI email. 

Day 1 text can be sent anytime really between 8am-9pm I’d say with our normal messaging. 

Day 2- the email seems a little wordy and long. I’m worried they won’t read all that? (lets optimize this for CRO)

Day 3 email - the PS should be removed as we don’t connect prior clients to prospects. 

Day 4 text- wait on this till we get the link 

Day 7 Email - we don’t have a Pinterest board. (I've made one and you have the link)

Day 9 text- not sure we want to follow up about Pinterest and color schemes at this point in the process. Maybe something we discuss at planning should they utilize the Pinterest board 

Day 10 email- we only offer the champagne toast in our Cameron and Lizzie packages not the Simon. Also in this email the word rentals is used in rentals and decor I’d suggest not using the word rentals as these items are included with us and are not rentals. Under accommodation please change wording to changing spaces provided to the bridal couple as we want to remain gender neutral and note there are 2 provided for the couple. 

Day 12 email- #3 rename the coordinator to planner or director of events In the let’s talk section can remove the schedule a call go calendar no need to schedule. They can call me immediately or let me know I can reach out and I’ll call them that day 

Day 14- just in general this seems like a lot of touch points for emails and texts to send if we are not getting anyone response from them? (keep this)
