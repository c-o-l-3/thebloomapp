**Preview Text:** Your fairy tale has a home at Cameron Estate.

Hi there {{first\_name}},  
Congratulations\! I imagine you're hearing from quite a few venues right now, so let me share what makes Cameron Estate different.

We're a historic inn  (more than 225 years old\!) where your entire wedding unfolds in one place. Your ceremony, reception, and guest accommodations—all here on the estate. No coordinating multiple vendors across town. No transportation logistics. Just you, your people, and a beautiful weekend together. 

**What's included:**  
One transparent per-person price includes your ceremony space, reception venue, complete catering, full bar service, tables, linens, china, glassware, and our team orchestrating every detail. No separate venue rental fee. No hidden costs appearing weeks before your wedding.

**Choose your ceremony setting:**

* The Spring Garden — an intimate outdoor space beneath towering trees, overlooking Donegal Spring and a stunning reflection pond  
* The Conservatory — elegant indoor option with crystal chandeliers and a marble fireplace (beautiful in any weather)

**Your reception spaces:**

* Spring View Ballroom — intimate and refined, with crystal chandeliers, a fireplace, and views of the surrounding woodland  
* The Carriage House — dramatic and spacious with sparkling chandeliers,  perfect for larger celebrations

Because your guests can stay on-site, your wedding becomes a true weekend celebration rather than a single-day event.

**Ready to visit?**  
Most couples tell us they know within the first few minutes whether Cameron Estate feels right. I'd love to give you that experience.

## DAY 2 \- TOUCHPOINT 2B: Afternoon Email

**Send Trigger:** Day 2, 2pm  
**Send Time:** 2pm local time

**EMAIL:**

**Subject: A few things I wish every couple knew before touring venues**  
**Preview Text: You're about to see a lot of beautiful spaces. Here's what to actually pay attention to...**  
{{first\_name}},

You're probably about to visit several venues over the next few weeks, and honestly? They're all going to look gorgeous. That's the easy part.

Here's what I encourage couples to focus on instead—the stuff that actually affects your wedding day and the months leading up to it.

**Trust your gut when you walk in**  
Photos only tell you so much. When you visit in person, pay attention to:

* Can you actually see your wedding happening here? (Not someone else's Pinterest board—*yours*)  
* Does the space feel right for your vibe and guest count?  
* Do you feel welcomed, or like you're being sold to?

That last one matters more than you'd think.

**Get clarity on what "all-inclusive" actually means**  
Every venue defines this differently, and it's where hidden costs love to hide. Worth asking everywhere you visit:

* What's included in your base price vs. what costs extra?  
* Linens? Day-of coordinator? Cake cutting? Bartender fees?  
* Will there be any surprise charges later?

At Cameron Estate, our per-person price covers everything—venue, catering, full bar, all rentals, and our team managing the details. No separate venue fee. No gotchas. One clear number from the start.

**Think about what the planning process will actually feel like**  
Your venue choice determines how you'll spend the next year:

* Will you be coordinating five different vendors, or is everything handled by one team?  
* Who's managing your timeline, setup, and the inevitable day-of surprises?  
* If something goes sideways on your wedding day, who fixes it?

When one experienced team manages everything in one location, planning gets a lot easier (and your wedding day runs a lot smoother).

**Want to see how this works at Cameron Estate?**  
I'd love to show you around. Just reply with a few dates that work for a tour—or if you have questions about how we compare to other places you're visiting, I'm happy to talk through it. We have warm cookies and refreshments ready for you\! 

Best,

## DAY 3 \- TOUCHPOINT 3A: Email

**Send Trigger:** Day 3, 10am  
**Send Time:** 10am local time

**EMAIL:**

**Subject:** "We knew within minutes"  
**Preview Text:** Three couples share what made them choose Cameron Estate. Their stories might help you decide...

{{first\_name}},I wanted to share something with you.

When couples tour Cameron Estate, they often tell me they knew within the first few minutes whether it was right for them. Not because we have the fanciest ballroom or the most acreage—but because they could genuinely picture their wedding happening here.

Here's what three recent couples told me about their decision:

**"We looked at five venues. Cameron Estate was the only one where we could actually see our day unfolding. The all-inclusive approach meant we weren't stressed about coordinating vendors—we could just enjoy planning."**  
— Jennifer & Michael, October 2025

**"Our families loved it as much as we did. Having everyone stay on-site for the weekend made our wedding feel less like an event and more like a celebration with the people we love most."**  
— Rachel & David, June 2025

**"The pricing was crystal clear from our first conversation. No surprises, no hidden fees, no 'oh by the way this costs extra.' That peace of mind was worth everything."**  
— Amanda & Chris, September 2024

I don't know if Cameron Estate is the right fit for your celebration—only you can decide that. But if you're still exploring options, I'd love to give you the same experience these couples had: a chance to see the estate in person and envision your own wedding day here.

Ready to schedule your tour? Just reply with a few dates that work for you.  
I'm here when you're ready. I would love to hear your love story\!

Warmly,   
Lisa   
Wedding Specialist

P.S. If you'd like to speak with any of our recent couples about their experience, I'm happy to make that connection. Sometimes hearing from someone who's been where you are now is the most helpful thing.

## DAY 5- TOUCHPOINT 5: Email

**Send Trigger:** Day 5, 10am  
**Send Time:** 10am local time

**EMAIL:**  
**Subject: {{first\_name}}, can you see it?**  
**Preview Text: Close your eyes. Picture your wedding day. Where are you standing?**

{{first\_name}}, Here's a question worth sitting with for a minute:  
When you picture your wedding day—really picture it—where are you?  
Can you see yourself walking down an aisle surrounded by trees? Hear the sound of your guests' laughter floating across the lawn during cocktail hour? Feel what it's like to step into your reception and see everyone you love in one room?

**That feeling—that's what matters.**

Not the features list. Not the price comparison spreadsheet. Not even the logistics.  
The venue you choose should be the place where you can actually *see* your memories happening. Where you can imagine your dad's toast, your first dance, the moment you look around and think, "We did this. This is ours."  
I've watched hundreds of couples tour Cameron Estate, and the ones who book? They usually get quiet for a second during the tour. They look at each other. And you can see it click—they're not seeing *a* wedding anymore. They're seeing *their* wedding.

**Is that Cameron Estate for you?**

I don't know yet. But I'd love to give you the chance to find out.

Our calendar is filling up—a few couples who toured recently are making their final decisions this week. If you've been thinking about visiting, now's a good time.

Just reply with 2-3 dates that work for you, and I'll get you on the calendar.

Or if you're still exploring and not quite ready, that's okay too. This is a big decision. Take the time you need.

Warmly,

**Send Time:** 2pm local time

**EMAIL: Subject: We made you a Pinterest board**   
**Preview Text: Romantic garden party? Moody autumnal vibes? Black-tie elegance? Yes, yes, and yes...**

{{first\_name}}, Quick question: What does your dream wedding look like?

Soft and romantic with lots of candlelight? Bold and dramatic with rich, moody colors? Classic elegance? Boho garden party? Something totally unexpected that perfectly captures *you two*?

Here's the thing about Cameron Estate—it works for all of it.

We've hosted intimate garden ceremonies with 50 guests and grand ballroom celebrations with 200\. We've seen soft blush and ivory palettes, jewel-tone autumn weddings, modern minimalist designs, and everything in between. The estate doesn't dictate your style—it adapts to it.

**That's why we created a Pinterest board for you.**  
It's packed with real weddings from Cameron Estate showing just how versatile this space is:

* Romantic spring garden ceremonies under the trees  
* Elegant candlelit receptions in the Spring View Ballroom  
* Dramatic fall weddings with rich burgundy and gold  
* Intimate winter celebrations by the fireplace  
* Bold, modern designs that feel totally fresh

**Browse our Pinterest board here → ([https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=the%20cameron%20estate\&rs=typed](https://www.pinterest.com/search/pins/?q=the%20cameron%20estate&rs=typed))**

Whether you're dreaming of something timeless and traditional or completely unique to you, you'll see how other couples have made Cameron Estate their own.  
And honestly? Half the fun of wedding planning is discovering what resonates with you. So grab a coffee, open Pinterest, and see what makes you say "oh, THAT's us."  
If something catches your eye (or if you want to talk through how your vision would work here), just reply. I love these conversations.

Happy pinning\!

P.S. No two Cameron Estate weddings look the same, and that's exactly how we like it. Your wedding should feel like *yours*—not like you walked into someone else's.

**Send Trigger:** Day 10, 2pm  
**Send Time:** 2pm local time

**EMAIL:**

**Subject:** What "all-inclusive" really means at Cameron Estate  
**Preview Text:** Not all all-inclusive packages are created equal. Here's exactly what's included in ours—and what you handle elsewhere...

{{first\_name}}, You're probably seeing "all-inclusive" at every venue you research. But here's what I've learned after years in this industry: that term means something different at every venue.

Let me show you exactly what it means at Cameron Estate.

WHAT'S INCLUDED IN YOUR PER-PERSON PRICE:  
**Venue & Spaces:**

* Ceremony location (garden, conservatory, or grounds)  
* Cocktail hour space  
* Reception ballroom  
* No separate venue rental fee

**Food & Beverage:**

* Full plated dinner service  
* Champagne toast  
* Premium open bar (beer, wine, liquor, mixers)  
* Bartender services  
* All glassware, china, flatware

**Rentals & Décor:**

* Tables and chairs for ceremony and reception  
* Linens (tablecloths and napkins in your choice of colors)  
* Centerpiece vases  
* Cake cutting and service

**Staffing & Coordination:**

* Event coordinator (timeline planning, vendor coordination, day-of management)  
* Professional wait staff  
* Bar staff  
* Setup and cleanup crew

**Accommodations:**

* Access to on-site guest rooms (separate booking)  
* Bridal suite preparation space

WHAT YOU HANDLE SEPARATELY (but we have great recommendations\!):

* Flowers and floral design  
* Photography and videography  
* Music/DJ/Band  
* Wedding cake  
* Invitations and paper goods  
* Your dress, attire, rings

THE DIFFERENCE THIS MAKES:  
Instead of coordinating with a venue, caterer, rental company, bar service, day-of coordinator, and setup crew—you coordinate with one person at one place. Your planning becomes simpler. Your costs become clearer. Your wedding day becomes smoother.

Compare this to other venues you're considering. Ask them specifically what's included and what costs extra. The details matter.

Want to see how this works in person? Reply with a few dates for your tour.

Best, Lisa Wedding Specialist Cameron Estate Inn 717-725-4831

P.S. I'm happy to walk through a sample budget comparison with you if that would be helpful—showing what our all-inclusive price covers versus what you'd pay piecing it together elsewhere.

## DAY 12 \- TOUCHPOINT 8: Email

**Send Trigger:** Day 12, 10am  
**Send Time:** 10am local time

**EMAIL:**

**Subject:** Questions couples ask at this stage

**Preview Text:** You're probably wondering about deposits, cancellations, and what-ifs. Let me answer those now...

{{first\_name}}, Twelve days into your venue search, most couples are asking themselves similar questions. Let me address what I hear most often:

**"WHAT IF WE FIND SOMETHING BETTER?"**  
You might. But you've now seen Cameron Estate and know what matters to you. You have clarity on what "better" would need to offer. Trust that clarity.

**"IS THE PRICING REALLY FINAL?"**  
Yes. Your proposal includes everything we discussed. The per-person price covers all food, beverage, venue, rentals, and coordination. No surprises, no hidden fees, no add-ons you didn't expect.

**"WHAT IF WE NEED TO CANCEL?"**  
Life happens, and we understand that. Our deposit structure:

* Initial deposit holds your date  
* Payment schedule spreads remaining balance over your engagement  
* Cancellation and postponement terms are clear and fair

I'm happy to walk through the specific terms with you—just ask.

**"HOW DO WE KNOW IT'S THE RIGHT CHOICE?"**  
Honestly? You won't know completely until your wedding day. But most couples tell us they felt relief, not anxiety, when they made their decision. They felt ready to stop searching and start planning.

**"WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IF WE BOOK?"**

1. You select your date and secure it with a deposit  
2. We schedule a planning meeting to discuss your vision in detail  
3. You receive a dedicated coordinator who guides you through every step  
4. We handle vendor coordination, timeline planning, and day-of execution  
5. You show up on your wedding day, and we handle everything
